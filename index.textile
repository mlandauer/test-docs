h1. Open Australia development of website and parser

Welcome to the development site for "openaustralia.org":http://www.openaustralia.org/. This is where we host the bug database for openaustralia.org.

The Open Australia software consists of two main components, the web application which is based on code from the UK site theyworkforyou.com and a web scraper / parser which was written from scratch for downloading and parsing the Hansard data from the Australian Parliament website.

All of the software is *free* and *open source*.

The web application code is licensed under a "BSD type license":https://secure.mysociety.org/cvstrac/fileview?f=mysociety/twfy/LICENSE.txt&v=1.1. The web scraper / parser is licensed under the "GNU Affero General Public License":http://github.com/mlandauer/openaustralia-parser/tree/master%2FLICENSE.txt?raw=true.
